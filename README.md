# Streamlit_ML
Within this Streamlit application, we employ machine learning algorithms to predict the age of individuals who have a high likelihood of developing Parkinson's Disease. Our best model was the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB), due to its low RMSE and MAE score.

Application can be found here: https://arosenswie-streamlit-ml-miniproject-app-6xu6kx.streamlit.app/.

Presented below is a histogram comparing the ages of the training dataset to the predicted ages generated by the XGB model using the validation set.
